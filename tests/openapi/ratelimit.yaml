        Query that will be matched against quotas

        # Matching rules
        ---------------

        Quota matches the query if at least one of it's predicates (match section) matches the query.
        Predicate matches query if all its key/values are present and match key/values of the request query.
        If query key is not present in the predicate, it is disregarded.

        ## Example:

        given predicate:


        `
        {
          'carrier': 'MEGB'
          'endpoint': 'location'
        }
        `

        match results on queries:


        `?carrier=MEGB&endpoint=locations` - OK


        `?carrier=MEGB` - No match


        `?carrier=MEGB&endpoint=locations&sender=retailer-api` - OK


        `?carrier=MEGB&sender=retailer-api` - No match


        `?sender=retailer-api` - No match

            Number of sequential cells allowed in a single burst
            A burst or clump of packets can arrive at a higher rate than determined by the emission interval
            In case there is unused burst capacity, quota can also exceed RPM in certain time frames.
            Burst capacity of 0 ensure that RPM is never exceeded but introduces a lot of delay.
            Burst capacity does not affect Sustainable Cell Rate
