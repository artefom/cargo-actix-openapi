          Burst capacity of 0 ensure that RPM is never exceeded but introduces a lot of delay.

          Query that will be matched against quotas

          # Matching rules
          ---------------

          Quota matches the query if at least one of it's predicates (match section) matches the query.
          Predicate matches query if all its key/values are present and match key/values of the request query.
          If query key is not present in the predicate, it is disregarded.

          ## Example:

          given predicate:


          `
          {
            'carrier': 'MEGB'
            'endpoint': 'location'
          }
          `

          match results on queries:


          `?carrier=MEGB&endpoint=locations` - OK


          `?carrier=MEGB` - No match


          `?carrier=MEGB&endpoint=locations&sender=retailer-api` - OK


          `?carrier=MEGB&sender=retailer-api` - No match


          `?sender=retailer-api` - No match
