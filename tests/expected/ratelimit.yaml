            Query that will be matched against quotas

            # Matching rules
            ---------------

            Quota matches the query if at least one of it's predicates (match section) matches the query.
            Predicate matches query if all its key/values are present and match key/values of the request query.
            If query key is not present in the predicate, it is disregarded.

            ## Example:

            given predicate:


            `
            {
              'carrier': 'MEGB'
              'endpoint': 'location'
            }
            `

            match results on queries:


            `?carrier=MEGB&endpoint=locations` - OK


            `?carrier=MEGB` - No match


            `?carrier=MEGB&endpoint=locations&sender=retailer-api` - OK


            `?carrier=MEGB&sender=retailer-api` - No match


            `?sender=retailer-api` - No match
